<h1>History of the Club</h1>
<p>WHWTCOPS was founded on July 22, 1982 through the efforts of Mary & Geoff Charles, Kathy Cole, Marilyn Lingren, and Nick & Emily Fisher. The club's first match took place on August 28, 1982, and drew an entry of 26.</p>
<p>Soon the membership grew and like most dog clubs, this one promoted education and activities for everyone interested in Westies as well as providing a meeting forum for Westie lovers. After a few years the membership proceeded to host a Speciality show with AKC approval. The officers applied to become a recognized club under the parent club, the West Highland White Terrier Club of America. In 1988 the WHWTCOPS sponsored the National Roving Specialty. In 1989 the club held its first Speciality and holds the distinction of being the first regional club to incorporate obedience as part of its Speciality. In 2010 the club will have celebrated its 28th anniversary.</p>
<p>TODAY - WHWTCOPS has nearly 86 members from a wide variety of backgrounds and interests. The club sponsors shows, educational seminars, and fun get togethers to promote Westies. Please check out the calendar section of our website and see our line up. The club is also active in Westie Rescue for Westies who are in need of new homes. We cover Washington as well as Oregon in our rescue work.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make life better for our beloved Westies, be ambassadors for our breed and for our club breeders to breed the best quality and health to continue the line. Whether you are a member or simply a visitor, we welcome you to our site and hope you find what you need and enjoy what you see. Please contact us for any questions.
